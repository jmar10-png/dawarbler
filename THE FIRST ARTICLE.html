<MULTICOL COLS="4" GUTTER="10"> The 126th Independence Day of the Philippines comes amid such tension and turmoil. 
	<p> We, as Filipinos, honor and commemorate the history of our hard-fought independence, and we must continue to fight against impending threats toward our fundamental rights and principles. The nation's quest for maritime sovereignty and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea has been riddled with challenges caused by China. From their aggresive water cannons down to their blatant display of harassment, Filipinos have seen the pristine waters of the West Philippine Sea turn grim as they repeatedly violate the very sea our country has the right of protecting.</p>
	<p> Now more than ever, The Warbler is one with the people who continue to strive to help fight oppression in our country, particularly the one in the West Philippine Sea. Our commitment to amplifying the truth remains relentless in this dark time. We encourage every Filpino to take action. Let us be steadfast in fighting for what is truly ours. </p>
